# Close Tab Button Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a close tab button feature for the Smart Tab Switcher browser extension. The feature allows users to close tabs directly from the search results interface.

## Requirements

### User Story
As a user, I want to be able to close tabs directly from the search results so that I can manage my tabs more efficiently without having to switch to them first.

### Functional Requirements
1. Close button should appear when hovering over or selecting tab-type results
2. Close button should be positioned in the top-left corner of the result item
3. Clicking the close button should close the corresponding tab
4. Delete key should close the currently selected tab
5. Only tab-type results should show the close button (not bookmarks, URLs, or search results)
6. Search results should update immediately after closing a tab
7. Selected index should be adjusted appropriately after closing tabs

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Visual feedback with hover effects and tooltips
- Prevent accidental tab closure by using event.stopPropagation()
- Maintain keyboard navigation functionality
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
The implementation follows the existing component architecture:
- `ResultItem`: Updated to include close button UI
- `ResultList`: Passes close handler to ResultItem components
- `SearchView`: Orchestrates the close functionality
- `useSearch`: Implements core tab closing logic
- `useKeyboard`: Adds Delete key support

### API Usage
- `browser.tabs.remove(tabId)`: Core API for closing tabs
- React state management for UI updates
- Event handling for mouse and keyboard interactions

### Data Flow
1. User hovers over or selects a tab result → Close button appears
2. User clicks close button or presses Delete key → Event captured
3. Event handler calls closeTab function → browser.tabs.remove() executed
4. Local state updated → Search results and selected index adjusted
5. UI re-renders → Close button disappears, results list updated

## Implementation Details

### Components Modified

#### ResultItem (`src/popup/components/result-item.tsx`)
- Added `onClose?: () => void` prop
- Added hover state tracking with `useState`
- Added close button that appears on hover or selection for tab-type results
- Positioned close button at `top-0.5 left-0.5` in top-left corner
- Used `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent tab switching when clicking close button

#### ResultList (`src/popup/components/result-list.tsx`)
- Added `onCloseTab?: (tabId: string) => void` prop
- Passed close handler to ResultItem components for tab-type results only

#### SearchView (`src/popup/components/search-view.tsx`)
- Imported `closeTab` function from useSearch hook
- Passed closeTab to ResultList and handleDelete to SearchBox

#### SearchBox (`src/popup/components/search-box.tsx`)
- Added `onDelete?: () => void` prop
- Added Delete key handling in keyDown event handler
- Added keyboard shortcut hint for Delete key in UI

### Hooks Modified

#### useSearch (`src/popup/hooks/use-search-complete.tsx`)
- Added `closeTab` async function that:
  - Calls `browser.tabs.remove(tabId)`
  - Updates local tabs state
  - Filters closed tab from search results
  - Adjusts selected index if necessary
- Exported closeTab function in return object

#### useKeyboard (`src/popup/hooks/use-keyboard.tsx`)
- Added `onCloseTab?: (tabId: string) => Promise<void>` parameter
- Added `handleDelete` function that closes selected tab if it's a tab-type result
- Exported handleDelete in return object

### Styling and UX
- Close button: 20x20px circular button with semi-transparent background
- Hover effects: Background darkens on button hover
- Tooltip: "Close tab" appears on button hover
- Visual feedback: Button appears/disappears smoothly with CSS transitions
- Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Closing current active tab**: Handled by browser's default behavior
2. **Closing last search result**: Selected index adjusted to prevent out-of-bounds
3. **Closing non-existent tab**: Error handling with try-catch blocks
4. **Rapid clicking**: Event handlers prevent multiple simultaneous requests
5. **Keyboard vs mouse interaction**: Both methods work consistently

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Uses Manifest V3, full functionality supported
- **Firefox**: Uses Manifest V2, full functionality supported
- **Edge**: Chromium-based, same as Chrome implementation

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Close button appears on hover for tab items
- [ ] Close button appears when tab item is selected
- [ ] Close button does not appear for bookmarks, URLs, or search results
- [ ] Clicking close button closes the correct tab
- [ ] Delete key closes selected tab when it's a tab-type result
- [ ] Search results update after closing tab
- [ ] Selected index adjusts correctly after closing tabs
- [ ] Hover effects work as expected
- [ ] Tooltip displays correctly
- [ ] No interference with tab switching functionality

### Cross-Browser Testing
All functionality should be tested in:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Performance Impact

- Minimal impact on rendering performance
- Close button rendered conditionally to reduce DOM nodes
- State updates are batched and optimized
- No additional API calls during normal operation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Undo functionality**: Show toast notification with undo option after closing
2. **Batch operations**: Allow closing multiple selected tabs
3. **Confirmation dialog**: Optional confirmation for important tabs
4. **Animation**: Smooth fade-out animation when closing tabs
5. **Custom shortcuts**: Allow users to configure different close shortcuts

## Conclusion

The close tab button feature enhances user productivity by allowing direct tab management from the search interface. The implementation maintains the extension's performance and usability while adding powerful new functionality.
